Hello, Iâ€™m Jonathan. 

I'm a tutor and mentor specialising in AD(H)D, specific learning difficulties (SpLDs) and trauma, as well as helping students with study skills, focus, motivation and self-confidence. 

I work mostly with young adults at University and teenagers in secondary school, tutoring a [wide range of subjects](/experience-and-subject-areas/) at various levels across the syllabus. 

Common situations in which families reach out for help include:

- Your child is creative and bright, but they have important exams or studies coming up, and you feel they would benefit from support
- Issues with timetabling / keeping appointments are causing stress at home or at school
- They display signs of anxiety and low self-esteem, or can be difficult to communicate with
- Your child is suspected of having or has been diagnosed with a learning difficulty / mental health condition, and you are unsure what it means and how to support them 

If any of the above seem familiar, please [get in touch](https://www.octuition.co.uk/about-us/meet-the-team/private-tutor/jonathan-walton) for a free chat.
